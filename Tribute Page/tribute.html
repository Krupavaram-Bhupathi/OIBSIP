<h2>Here's Guido Von Rossum's journey</h2>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>
    Guido van Rossum,born 31 January 1956 is a Dutch programmer best known as the creator of the Python programming language, for which he was the "benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position on 12 July 2018.He remained a member of the Python Steering Council through 2019, and withdrew from nominations for the 2020 election.
</p>
<h3>Google</h3>
<p>
    From 2005 to December 2012, he worked at Google, where he spent half of his time developing the Python language. At Google, Van Rossum developed Mondrian, a web-based code review system written in Python and used within the company. He named the software after the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian. He named another related software project after Gerrit Rietveld, a Dutch designer. On 7 December 2012, Van Rossum left Google.
</p>
<h3>Microsoft</h3>
<p>
    On 12 November 2020 Van Rossum announced that he was coming out of retirement to join the Developer Division at Microsoft. He currently holds the title Distinguished Engineer at Microsoft.
</p>


</p>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>
    In December 1989, Van Rossum had been looking for a "'hobby' programming project that would keep [him] occupied during the week around Christmas" as his office was closed when he decided to write an interpreter for a "new scripting language [he] had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers". He attributes choosing the name "Python" to "being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus)".

    He has explained that Python's predecessor, ABC, was inspired by SETL, noting that ABC co-developer Lambert Meertens had "spent a year with the SETL group at NYU before coming up with the final ABC design".
    
    On 12 July 2018, Van Rossum announced that he would be stepping down from the position of BDFL of the Python programming language.
</p>
<h3>"Computer Programming for Everybody" proposal</h3>
<p>
    In 2019, Python became the second most popular language on GitHub, the largest source code management website on the internet, second only to JavaScript. According to a programming language popularity survey it is consistently among the top 10 most mentioned languages in job postings. Furthermore, Python has been among the 10 most popular programming languages every year since 2004 according to the TIOBE Programming Community Index and got the number one spot on the index in October 2021.
